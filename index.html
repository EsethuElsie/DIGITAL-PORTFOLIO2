                    <p>During my hybrid internship at Masebo Networks, I was responsible for managing internal and external communication through digital platforms such as Microsoft Teams and email.

                        <strong>Situation:</strong>
                        <p>When I first joined Masebo Networks I was given a task to create a survey for companies that might be interested in doing WIL internships.</p>

                        <strong>Task:</strong>
                        <p>My task was to find out if there are companies interested on WIL and finding out their struggles with not implementing or even feedback from the ones that already did. It was also my responsibility to make sure that my daily reports reflected accurate project updates so that my supervisor and the rest of the team could make informed decisions.</p>

                    <div class="star-item">
                        <strong>Action:</strong>
                        <p>To address this, I introduced a survey internally first before putting in on LinkedIn and any available platforms. By maintaining open communication lines, I ensured that information flowed efficiently.</p>

                        <p>The implementation of these strategies significantly reduced miscommunication and improved overall productivity. My supervisor commended my initiative and attention to detail in streamlining project updates. Through this experience, I learned that effective business communication is about being proactive, organized, and clear — qualities that I will continue to apply in future professional settings.</p>

I practiced answering typical interview questions using the STAR technique to provide structured and relevant responses.

During the interview, I maintained eye contact with the camera, spoke clearly, and provided real examples of how I solved challenges in my coursework.</p>
